# Discord OwO Ticket Notify

## Important Note
This code has been intentionally restricted to minimize the risk of being detected by Discord. Since it is a self-bot, it only runs and logs notifications in the console. However, self-bots violate Discordâ€™s Terms of Service, which can lead to account termination. If you want to unlock the full potential of this bot, consider using the dedicated bot version that I have prepared: [Discord_OwO_Ticket_Notify_Bot](https://github.com/lethinh26/Discord_OwO_Ticket_Notify_Bot).

## Introduction
Discord OwO Ticket Notify is a self-bot that monitors the #seller-ads channel in the Support OwO server for stock-related messages. If someone posts a message indicating they are selling a ticket, the bot extracts relevant stock information and stores it in a MongoDB database. This allows for real-time tracking of ticket availability.

## Features
- Monitors messages in a specified channel for stock updates.
- Extracts and stores stock information from messages.
- Updates stock details if messages are edited.
- Removes stock records if messages are deleted.
