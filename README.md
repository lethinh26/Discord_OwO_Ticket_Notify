# Discord OwO Ticket Notify

## Important Note
Since this is a self-bot, it only runs and logs notifications in the console. It has limited practicality as using self-bots violates Discordâ€™s Terms of Service, increasing the risk of account termination. To avoid detection and potential account loss, consider upgrading to the dedicated bot version that I have prepared: [Discord_OwO_Ticket_Notify_Bot](https://github.com/lethinh26/Discord_OwO_Ticket_Notify_Bot).

## Introduction
Discord OwO Ticket Notify is a self-bot that monitors the #seller-ads channel in the Support OwO server for stock-related messages. If someone posts a message indicating they are selling a ticket, the bot extracts relevant stock information and stores it in a MongoDB database. This allows for real-time tracking of ticket availability.

## Features
- Monitors messages in a specified channel for stock updates.
- Extracts and stores stock information from messages.
- Updates stock details if messages are edited.
- Removes stock records if messages are deleted.
